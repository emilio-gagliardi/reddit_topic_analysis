CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversations?"

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears.

Alice fell and fell for what seemed like forever until she finally landed with a splash in a large pool of tears. She looked around and saw that she was surrounded by a sea of her own tears, and she began to cry even harder.

As she cried, she noticed that she was slowly shrinking, until she was no larger than a mouse. She tried to swim to the edge of the pool, but the waves of her own tears carried her farther and farther away.

Finally, she reached the edge of the pool and tried to climb out, but the bank was so steep that she could not get a foothold. She sat down and cried again, and as she cried she saw a little mouse swimming towards her.

At first, Alice was afraid of the mouse, but then she realized that it was no ordinary mouse. It was a mouse with a waistcoat and a pocket-watch, just like the White Rabbit she had seen earlier.

The mouse climbed out of the pool and began to dry itself with a handkerchief. Alice tried to talk to the mouse, but it was too busy drying itself to pay her any attention.

Finally, the mouse finished drying itself and introduced itself to Alice. Its name was William, and it was a member of the Mouse Council. Alice was surprised to learn that there was such a thing as a Mouse Council, and she asked William if she could join.

William looked at Alice skeptically and asked her if she knew how to solve a riddle. Alice said that she did not, but she was willing to try. William then recited a long and complicated riddle, which Alice found very confusing.

She tried to answer the riddle, but every answer she gave was wrong. William was very disappointed in her and told her that she was not fit to join the Mouse Council.

Alice was very upset by this and began to cry again. As she cried, she realized that she was growing larger and larger, until she was once again her normal size. The pool of tears had vanished, and Alice was left standing on a dry bank.

She looked around and saw that she was in a strange room, with doors on every side. She tried to open the doors, but they were all locked. She began to wonder how she was going to get out of the room and back home.

CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale.

Alice looked around the room, wondering how she was going to get out. Suddenly, she noticed that there was a little door behind a curtain. She opened the door and found a tiny garden with a little glass table, a fan, and a tiny bottle labeled "Drink Me."

Alice was curious and picked up the bottle, examining it closely. She hesitated for a moment, wondering if it was safe to drink, but finally, she decided to take a sip.

To her surprise, the drink made her shrink down to just ten inches tall. Alice was delighted and ran around the garden, exploring all the tiny plants and flowers. She even found a little cake labeled "Eat Me" and took a bite, hoping it would make her grow back to her normal size.

Unfortunately, the cake had the opposite effect, and Alice shrunk even smaller than before. She realized that she was going to need to find another way to grow back to her normal size.

Just then, she heard a commotion in the distance and saw a group of strange creatures coming towards her. They were all dripping wet and looked very odd, with long beaks and webbed feet.

As they approached her, Alice realized that they were all different animals, including a Dodo, a Lory, a Duck, a Mouse, and a group of birds. They explained to Alice that they had just finished a Caucus-race, and that they were all winners because no one knew exactly where the finish line was.

Alice was fascinated by this idea and asked if she could join in the next race. The creatures agreed, and Alice joined in the strange race, which had no real beginning or end.

After the race, the animals all sat down to dry off and began to tell stories. Alice was particularly interested in the Mouse's tale, which was about a crocodile with a very long tail.

As the Mouse told his tale, Alice found herself growing larger and larger, until she was too big for the tiny garden. She realized that she must have grown back to her normal size, and she decided that it was time to explore the strange world she had stumbled upon.
